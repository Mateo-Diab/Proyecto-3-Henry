            Hello! My name is Mateo Nallib Diab, and I’m from Santa Fe, Argentina. I speak English, Italian, French, and my native language, Spanish. I have a passion for frontend development and am currently expanding my skills at the Soy Henry bootcamp, where I’m now progressing through Module 3. My focus is on building responsive, user-centered designs that combine functionality with aesthetic appeal. I’m driven by a love for problem-solving and innovation, and I look forward to every opportunity to deepen my knowledge and contribute to the tech community!
